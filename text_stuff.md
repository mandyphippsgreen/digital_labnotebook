# Notes on bold, italics, and strikethroughs

If you want to **bold** or *italics* use the asterick on either side - 2 for bold, 1 for italics

You can use underscores for the __same effect__ / _same effect_

If you want bold and italics combined, **_bold_** use both asterisk and underscore

Strikethrough is annotated with tilde ~strikemedowndead~
